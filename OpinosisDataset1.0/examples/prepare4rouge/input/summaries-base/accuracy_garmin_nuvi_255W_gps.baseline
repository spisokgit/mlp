[1]  I used it the day I bought it, and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is ready to navigate The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100 accurate .
[2]  0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive, accurate, plenty of features, August 6, 2009 The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100 accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .
